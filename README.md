# Mnemonica

This program has two modes, and both of them need a list of things to memorize that you can add on the command line<br><br>
Rune program.exe mnemonica.txt as an example<br><br>
mnemonica.txt is the Mnemonica card stack<br><br>
You can devide the text file into sections with the # string. Right now mnemonica.txt is devided into four sections<br><br>
Instead of restarting the program from the beginning you can jump to one of those sections by typing part or all of the section name<br><br>
<br>
The next part of the program gives you the history of the stack as hints. You still work through all 52 cards, but you can decide how many of the cards before it to showm, and of course reshuffle if you want.<br><br>
